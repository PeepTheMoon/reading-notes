## Structure

* Very similar to a newspaper.
* the HTML structure also describes the structure of the web pages.
* HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags, usually in pars, which tell us about the content of an element.

### Extra Markup

* HTML has several versions and need a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration to tell the browser which version the page is using.
* <!--comments in HTML look like this>
* An id or class attribute is named in the tag element and uniquely identify that element.
* Types of elements include:
1. block using <div>
1. inline using <span>
1. iframes for adding windows to other webpages <iframe>
1. <meta> contains info not visible to users.
1. escape characters are used to include special characters.

#### HTML5 layout

* HTML5 layout has new elements that help describe the layout and structure of a webpage to avoid 'div soup.'
* Older browsers need to be told which elements are block level elements.
* In IE8 and older, extra JavaScript is needed to make HTML5 elements work.

 ##### Process and Design

* It's important to consider who the site you're building is for and how you will organize your information for them.
* Consider WHY they're coming, WHAT they want to achieve and WHAT they need.
* Sitemaps help plan the structure of a site by organizing into sections or pages.
* Wireframes sketches out key info, the heirarchy of that info, and space required for each section.
* Tools like visual heirarchy, grouping and similairty, and using sizing and color help to organize info.
