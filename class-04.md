# HTML Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” (pp.74-93)
Types of links: <a>
1. from one site to another
2. one page to anotehr on same site
3. from one part of a page to another part of same page
4. links that open in a new window
5. links that sart up an email prgram and address a new email.

## HTML Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)
CSS treats every elements as if it were in its own box.  They can be:
1. Inline - flows between surrounding text.  appears like one box.
2. Block-level boxes atart on a new line.

block-level emements can sit(nest) inside other elements, making the outer box known as the parent or containing element.

Positioning schemes help to control layout of a page:
1. Normal flow (default). each element appears on new line.
2. relative positioning shifts an element from where it would be in noraml flow
3. absolute- positioned in realtion to the ontaining element.  doesn't affect positioning of surrounding elements.  moves as a user scrolls.
4. fixed- form of absolute positioning, positions relative to browser window. doesn't affect surrounding elements and doesn't move when user scrolls
5. floating elements- takes an element out of normal flow and positions to far r or l of containing box.  becomes a block-level element around which other content can flow.

things can overlap.  z-index controls which appears on top.

box offset tells browser how far from top, bottom, l or r to position a box.

### Chapter 3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.86-99 ONLY)
functions group statements together to perform a specific task.

They can be stored to be called on later or can be invoked immediately instead of being stored.

use anonymous functions and IIFEs when it only needs to run once within a task.

where you declare a function will affect where it can be used (scope)
1. global- declared outside of a function and can be used anywhere
2. local- declared within a function and can only be used within the function.

too many global variables means the browser has to remember a lot (takes up memory) and can perform more slowly.

global variables and cause naming issues since they can only be used once.

#### Article: “6 Reasons for Pair Programming”
Pair programming helps produce better code.

one person is a driver and the other is a navigator.  The driver writes the code and the navigator helps provide direction and researches solutions and scans for typos and bugs.

allows for:
1. greater efficiency
2. engaged collaboration
3. learning from fellow students
4. social skills
5. job interview readiness
6. work environment readiness
