# HTML/CSS book, Ch. 15, “Layout” (again; repeat of Class 4 reading)
Think of working in CSS as working with blocks where each element is in its own box.  

1. block level elements start on a new line
2. inline elements flow in between surround text
3. containing elements are the parent element of other block elements inside it

Controlling positiioning of elements:
1. normal flow
2. relative positiioning
3. Absolute positioning
4. fixed positioning
5. floating elements
 You can use float to place elements side by side.  They can also create multi column layouts

 fixed width layouts don't change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.  Liqiuid elements do.

 Layout grids help to organize info on a page
