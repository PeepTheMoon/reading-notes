### JS Chapter 6: “Events” (pp.243-292)
Interactions crate events, events trigger code, and code responds to users.
 Types of events on p246-247

 Event handlers and event listners help bind an event to an element.

Event flow is important if you have event handlers  
 The event object tells you info about the event and and the element it happened upon.  

 Creating event listners on a lot of element can slow down a page, but event flows allow you to listen for an event on a parent element.

 You can use preventDefault() or stopPropagation() to change the default behavior of an element.

 Good chart on p268 about event delegation.

 binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen and which elements you are waiting for that to happen upon.
